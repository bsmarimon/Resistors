Resistors
=========

A functional GUI for calculating resistor values. Input color bands of resistors, output is resistance in Ohms. 

* Currently only supports 4 band resistors, working on allowing for input: resistance in Ohms -> output: colors bands of corresponding resistor and allowing for 5, 6 band resistors.

Inspired by lab work in UC Berkeley's EE40 course.
